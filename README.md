### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```JS
async function fetchLiveData(){
  const data = await fetch('./data.json');
  const body = await data.json();
  const dailyData = body.map(type => (
    {
      time: type.timeframes.daily,
      title: type.title,
    }
  ))
  const weeklyData = body.map(type => (
    {
      time: type.timeframes.weekly,
      title: type.title,
    }
  ))
  const monthlyData = body.map(type => (
    {
      time: type.timeframes.monthly,
      title: type.title,
    }
  ))
  document.querySelector('#panel-container').innerHTML = generateCardHTMLString({
    daily: dailyData,
    weekly: weeklyData,
    monthly: monthlyData,
  })
}

fetchLiveData()
```
```css
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) {
  .container--timecards {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to working on my javascript as well with Jquery. since the code is significantly different from the most programming languanges I've learned. In addition, I also want to explore more about HTML and CSS because it would make our website more captivating and interactive.

### Useful resources

- [Gap in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gap) - This helped me for gap in css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Fetch JSON file in JS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-read-json-file-in-javascript/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand fetch. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
